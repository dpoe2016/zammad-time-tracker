## 💡 Quick Tips

### Organizing Your Backlog
- Use the search box to find specific tickets
- Filter by state (New, Open, In Progress, Waiting)
- Higher priority tickets (P3, P4) show with red/orange badges

### During the Sprint
- Continue using regular time tracking on sprint tickets
- Check sprint progress in the stats bar
- Move tickets back to backlog if needed (just drag them!)

### Completing a Sprint
1. When sprint period ends, click **"Complete Sprint"**
2. Unfinished tickets automatically return to backlog
3. Review the final statistics
4. Create your next sprint!

## 📊 Understanding Sprint Stats

- **Total Tickets**: Number of tickets in the sprint
- **Completed**: Tickets in "Closed" state
- **Estimated Hours**: Sum of all ticket estimates
- **Progress**: Percentage of completed tickets

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Keep sprints short** - 1-2 weeks works best
2. **Don't overcommit** - Better to finish less than fail on more
3. **Estimate honestly** - Include time for testing and reviews
4. **Review regularly** - Check progress daily
5. **Complete sprints** - Don't let sprints run forever

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

```
Monday (Sprint Start)
├─ Create new sprint
├─ Drag priority tickets from backlog
├─ Estimate all tickets
└─ Start sprint

During Sprint (Days 1-10)
├─ Work on sprint tickets
├─ Track time as usual
├─ Update ticket states in Zammad
└─ Monitor progress

Friday (Sprint End)
├─ Complete sprint
├─ Review statistics
└─ Plan next sprint
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**No tickets in backlog?**
- Go back to main dashboard first
- Wait for tickets to load
- Then open Sprint Planning

**Can't drag tickets?**
- Make sure sprint is selected (not "Backlog")
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if JavaScript is enabled

**Stats not updating?**
- Click the Refresh button
- Check that tickets are in correct state in Zammad
- Verify estimates are saved

## 🎓 Next Steps

Once you're comfortable:
- Create multiple sprints and compare
- Experiment with different sprint lengths
- Track velocity (tickets per sprint)
- Use sprint goals to align team
